# Course-Schedule-Bot
A course schedule discord bot for University of Maryland. Since the official hours for viewing schedules are limited in the official site, I decided to create a bot that uses an API to allow 24/7 access to view class schedules. Also created a feature to notify a user when there is a open seat in a class they commanded. 

## Commands
* !course [courseName]

* !notify [courseName]

Once there is a open seat, the bot will tag the user who requested to be notified/
